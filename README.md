# MovieApp
Movie app code challenge

## Libraries used

MvvmCross : Cross-platform MvvmFramewok. Comes with a suit of good practices as using the main thread to set binding objects and observable collections.

Refit: Easy to use library to easen up the implementation of rest calls

Fusilade: Used to enable future usage of background and intuitive API calls

Polly: Used to enable auto-retry in case an API call fails

Akavache + SQLite: Used as cache mechanism so the app can run offline and reduce network usage

FFImageLoading: Used as image cache mechanism so the app can run offline and reduce network usage
